This is just for fun. 

Displaying density of traffic count volumes for the Denver region as measured by DRCOG. These counts are measured manually at specific locations around the region.  The data could be considered a statistical sampling of counts as the locations do not measure volumes throughout the year.  Each count location represents a volume count for a specific day.
